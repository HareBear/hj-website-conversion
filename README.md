In class demo of static site conversion

This repository reflects the converison of a static website (a template from freewebsitetemplates.com)
into a reasonable CodeIgniter webapp.. I will usee branches to reflect the webapp state after
each conversion stage (separate lab 3 tutorials for COMP4711 and ACIT4850). That way, you can switch 
branches in your IDE to view the evolution of the site :)

I will add notes here, but the general plan is 

0) setup;
1) convert to a trivial CI site;
2) convert to a basic CI site (view templating);
3) convert to a good CI site (using models)
